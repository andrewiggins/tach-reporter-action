## Usage

### Single benchmark job

```yaml
name: Pull Request Test

on: [pull_request]

jobs:
  pr_test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      # Setup repo to run benchmarks
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v1
      - run: npm ci

      # Run benchmarks
      - name: Run tachometer and generate results file
      - run: npm run tach --config benchmarks.json --json-file results.json

      # Read results and post comment
      - name: Report Tachometer Result
        uses: andrewiggins/tachometer-reporter-action@v2
        with:
          path: results.json
          report-id: benchmark1
```

### Multiple benchmark jobs

```yaml
name: PR Setup Job Flow

on: [pull_request]

# Demo how to use the setup job flow
#
# In this flow, a workflow must create a separate "setup" job that initializes
# the comment by passing initialize: true. Then each other job that actually
# reports benchmark results must declare the "setup" job as a dependency in its
# "needs" array.

jobs:
  setup:
    name: Setup Tachometer Reporting
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Initialize tachometer comment
        uses: andrewiggins/tachometer-reporter-action@v2
        with:
          initialize: true

  bench_1:
    name: First Bench Job
    # Wait for setup job to complete before running this job
    needs: [setup]
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      # Setup repo to run benchmarks
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v1
      - run: npm ci

      # Run benchmarks
      - name: Run tachometer and generate results file
      - run: npm run tach --config benchmarks.json --json-file results.json

      # Read results and post comment
      - name: Report Tachometer Result
        uses: andrewiggins/tachometer-reporter-action@v2
        with:
          path: results.json
          report-id: benchmark1

  bench_2:
    name: Second Bench Job
    # Wait for setup job to complete before running this job
    needs: [setup]
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2

      # Add other tasks similar to bench_1 job to run the second benchmark

      # Report second benchmark results
      - name: Report Other Tachometer Result
        uses: andrewiggins/tachometer-reporter-action@v2
        with:
          path: other-results.json
```

## Features

- Pick a summary of comparisons to highlight at the top
- See what benchmarks are currently running
<!-- - Keep a log of benchmark results from this PR -->

### Summaries

`tachometer-reporter-action` will generate a summary of results for you if you
provide a `pr-bench-name` and `base-bench-name`. This summary will take the
results of comparing the results identified by the `pr-bench-name` vs. the
results identified by the `base-bench-name` and put them at the top of the of
the comment.

By default, if `pr-bench-name` or `base-bench-name` are not provided, then the
first two benchmarks in the tachometer results will be compared.

### In-progress benchmarks

![Picture of a PR comment with icons indicating in progress benchmarks](./docs/in-progress-comment-with-results.png)

If the `report-id` option is provided, then `tachometer-reporter-action` will
add a stopwatch icon (‚è±) next to any benchmark that is currently running. If the
action can determine the current job id, then the icon is a link to the action
job that is running the benchmark (see #7).

### Multiple measurements in one benchmark

![Picture of a PR comment with multiple measurements per benchmark](./docs/multi-measurement-comment.png)

Tachometer supports defining multiple measurements per benchmark configuration.
In the summary section, we group summaries by measurements. In the result
details for each benchmark, we build tables for each measurement in that
benchmark.

## Inputs

### Required

#### path

The path to the results JSON file of the tachometer run.

### Optional

#### report-id

Give this report (i.e. results file) an ID to uniquely identify it against other
instances of tachometer-reporter action. If you have multiple jobs or steps all
running tachometer-reporter action for the same PR, use this field so that the
actions don't collide with each other

#### initialize

Use this option with `report-id`.

Determines whether this action instance should initialize the comment to report
results. Useful if multiple jobs are sharing the same comment. Pass in `true` if
this job should always create the comment, `false` if this job should never
create the comment, or leave empty if the default behavior is desired (wait a
random time before creating comment if it doesn't exist. Due to race conditions,
this could lead to duplicate comments and is not recommended if your workflow
has multiple jobs using this action).

Generally this option is only necessary if you are running multiple jobs in the
same workflow with this action. If so, create a "setup" job to that initializes
the comment by passing initialize: true. Then each other job that actually
reports benchmark results must declare the "setup" job as a dependency in its
"needs" array. See the [Multiple benchmark jobs](#multiple-benchmark-jobs) usage
sample for an example.

#### default-open

Pass `true` to this option to automatically open this actions benchmark results
in the PR comment. By default, all results are collapsed.

<!--
#### keep-old-results

Pass `true` to this option to keep old benchmarks results in the PR comment
(collapsed under the latest results). By default, the action will override any
existing benchmark results with the latest results.
-->

#### pr-bench-name

The benchmark or version (identified in Tachometer results by either the "name"
field or "version" field) which represents the changes made in this PR.

#### base-bench-name

The benchmark or version (identified in Tachometer results by either the "name"
field or "version" field) which serves as the base this PR is to be compared
against (e.g. the latest published version of your library/website).

## Notes

### Multiple comments

This action will create one comment per workflow that uses it. So if you have
two workflows that each run two jobs that use this action (a total of 4
instances of this action), you should have two comments in your PR.

By default, `tachometer-reporter-action` relies on a timing heuristic so that
multiple jobs don't try to create multiple comments at the same time. However
this timing heuristic doesn't work for all workflow configurations. To
workaround this use the [`initialize`](#initialize) option to instruct only one
`tachometer-reporter-action` instance in a workflow to initialize the comment
all other `tachometer-reporter-action`s will share. See the [Multiple benchmark
jobs](#multiple-benchmark-jobs) usage sample for an example.

### Sorting

The results are inserted into the comment based on the title of the benchmark
that produced the results. So a workflow that has multiple jobs reporting
results will show the results in the lexical order of their `report-id` inputs.
If no `report-id` is provided, a title is determined based on the name and
version fields of the tachometer benchmark results.

### Only latest updates are shown

If you quickly push to a PR, two different workflow runs could be triggered at
close to the same time. Depending on how long the benchmarks take to run, the
earlier workflow run running not the latest code could complete after the later
workflow run running the latest code.

To prevent this situation, where older out-of-date results could override the
latest results, only results that come from a workflow run with a run number
equal or higher to the current run number in the comment will be written.

### Cooperative comment locking

If you action has multiple benchmarks running in different jobs, it is possible
that the reporter-action will try to overwrite each other's results if both jobs
read the comment before either has updated it with their results. In this
situation, both jobs get a view of the comment with no results and only adds
their results to the comment. The last job whose update is written would
overwrite the update of the other job.

To mitigate this situation, this action implements a basic "locking" mechanism
on the comment. Before any job can make significant changes to the comment, it
must first write an empty `span` to the comment with an ID and wait a short time
to ensure all other jobs have seen it's `span`, claiming the comment as locked.
If another job sees that this `span` exists, it will wait a random amount of time
before trying to acquire the comment lock for itself. This protocol isn't perfect,
but it is likely good enough for our purposes.
